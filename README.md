# Delivery-accepting-system
A system to receive delivery on behalf of owner when he/she was not at home due to some reasons.

## Components required
1. Arduino Uno
2. Servo motor
3. LCD screen
4. Potentiometer
5. Jumper wires
6. A computer for serial montor

##Problem
Nowadays we are becoming increasingly reliant on online shopping platforms like Amazon and Flipkart,
which have their widespread supply and transport chains all over the country which deliver our packages
right to our house. But many times in this fast-paced world, we aren't able to receive the package at
the time of delivery in case we are out to the market or if we aren't at home at that exact time due to
any other reason. In such cases, the delivery is usually postponed to the next day which causes problems
if the item is an important one to be delivered in time. 

##Solution
We can made a box that can accept delivery on behalf of owner. As and when the delivery boy keeps the
package inside the box, the lid of the box should get closed. The system then randomly generate a 5-digit
unique code and send it to the owner along with a message of successful delivery . Afterwards when the
owner comes back, he/she can access the package by using the unique code which automatically opens the box lid.
